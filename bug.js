This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `react-native-web` support and trying to import or use modules that are not compatible with the web platform.  For example, modules that directly interact with native device features (like camera, sensors, etc.) will usually throw errors in web environments because those functionalities aren't present in a browser context.  Another common cause involves using a module that makes assumptions about the Node.js environment, which differs significantly from a browser's JavaScript environment.

Example of problematic import:
```javascript
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera'; // This will usually cause problems in web
```
